The Qurio text format allows anyone to write questionnaire's in an easy-to-read, easy-to-write, open, plain text format. By converting questionnaire's into JSON with the open source parser, questions can also be imported into http://qurio.co

Introduction
============

At [Qurio.co](http://qurio.co) our aim is to make it as simple as possible to ask questions and to collect and analyse the results. Although our users trust Qurio as the simplest way to create surveys, tests or quizzes, Qurio is just a tool — our users' biggest asset isn't Qurio, but their library of content and questions.

Since their roles often revolve around creating and presenting good content to their end­users, it's vitally important that they take good care of this content and carefully think through the best way to create and maintain it.

Most users, however, have their questions locked away in InDesign, Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel files. This makes it easy for humans to read and modify, but hard to convert these into a format computers can understand and use. In addition it's also hard to keep track of changes and versions of these files.

We've created the Qurio text format with the aim of being:

1. **Easy to create, read and edit for both humans and machines:** to use it, you don't have to spend valuable resources on teaching yourself or training others and there's no need for expensive software development work to integrate it into your product or workflow.

2. **An open, plain text format:** by making the specifications of this format publically available, anyone is free to create and edit content in this format and use it for their own project (whether that involves Qurio or not). Storing content in plain text also means it's easy for anyone to open and save files, as well as keep track of changes using existing version control software such as SVN, Mercurial or Git.

3. **Open Source and Free from vendor lock­in:** if Qurio or this format no longer meets your demands, you are free to adapt it to your liking without having to rewrite everything from scratch.
